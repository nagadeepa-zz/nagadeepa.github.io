My name is Daniel Shin, and I am a data scientist in New York City. After working as a biomedical researcher for 4 years, I decided I wanted to apply my quantitative and programming skills to solve more tangible business problems.

My interests brought me to a data science bootcamp, where I am currently building my skills in Python, machine learning, and data analysis. This blog will record a lot of the work I do throughout the bootcamp, as well as things I find interesting along the way.

I hope you enjoy!
