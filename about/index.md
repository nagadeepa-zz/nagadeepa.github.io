My name is Nagadeepa and I am a Data scientist from Seattle. 

My interests brought me to a data science Masters from Northwestern University, where I learnt about Machine Learning & Statistical Analysis of Big Data. 
I am interested in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
This blog will record a lot of the work/research about Artificial Intelligence I do throughout my journey as a data scientist, as well as things I find interesting along the way.

I hope you enjoy!
