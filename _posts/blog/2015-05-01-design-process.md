Having come from a hard sciences background, I find myself approaching a problem in more or less the same order.

1. What is the question?
2. Try to guess at an answer
3. Test the guess using whatever available methods
4. Make some conclusions

In the biological sciences, following this workflow step by step works well since experiments themselves can be long and expensive. It's important to cross your t's and dot your i's

In the real world, you run into a number of problems with this process:

* questions are not explicitly defined and/or constantly changing
* your data and your environment can change from second to second
* in the end your results might not really have any real-world application

As a data scientist, I'm learning (sometimes the hard way) about the importance of following the iterative design process.

When developing a product, designing an experiment, or really doing anything that we feel is important, it's natural to want a clear plan or to have the right conditions for what we're doing. However, too often we find ourselves failing to even get started.

Iterative design is a process where your workflow is broken down into phases (iterations), which you constantly cycle through as you move towards a final product. For example, you might ask your client what he or she wants, brainstorm on how to deliver, create a workable product, and then ask your client what they think before moving on and repeating the process.

There are several advantages to the iterative design process:

* You can respond quicker to changes in client needs or the environment you're working in
* It helps you to combat perfectionism
* It fits well with today's fast-paced work environment
* After each cycle, you have an actual product that you can show someone
* The client can steer you towards what will make them happy

As you can see it can be a win-win situation for both you and your client

Different people have different ideas for what the timeframe for each cycle should be, but remember:

* We are not perfect- it's okay to fail
* Less is more
* Something is better than nothing
